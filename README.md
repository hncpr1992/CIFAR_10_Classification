# CIFAR_10_Classification

In this course project, I experement with different depth of Convolutional Neural Network on the CIFAR-10 data, achieving final
prediction accuracy on test data about 85％

Regularization: <br>
batch-normalization, dropout, L2 regularization and data augmentation

Optimization: <br>
SGD, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam
